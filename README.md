# **CLASSIFICATION SPAM USING JUPYTER NOTEBOOK**


In today's digital era, spam messages are everywhere, from emails to text messages, making it crucial to filter out unwanted content efficiently. This project utilizes deep learning with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to classify messages as spam or ham (not spam) using Jupyter Notebook.




**üîç Project Overview**


Data Processing: The dataset undergoes preprocessing, including text tokenization, sequence padding, and label encoding.
Model Architecture: A Bidirectional LSTM model is trained to enhance spam classification accuracy.
Performance Evaluation: The model is assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring optimal spam detection.
Visualization: Data distribution and model performance are visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn.



**üõ† Technologies Used**


Jupyter Notebook for development
Python for data processing and model training
TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning implementation
Scikit-learn for preprocessing and evaluation metrics
Seaborn & Matplotlib for data visualization
